		<h1>Beaches of the United States Vigin Islands<i class="fa-solid fa-fish"></i></h1>
		<h2>St. Croix</h2>
		<p>
			During this summer I spent 91 days in the United States Virgin Islands(USVI)
			as part of a summer internship at the University of the Virgin Islands Research
			and Technology Park (RTPARK). This is enough days to be considered a full-time
			resident and get local status. This was interesting to be because a lot of the
			start-ups and companies that wanted to relocate here needed to get local status
			but for some it was too hard.

			The USVI has some of the most diverse history.
			- the United States brought the USVI in

			The tourism of the USVI brings in hundreds of thousands each year.
			The general population of all three islands can double in a night depending on
			the number of cruise ships that come in.

		St. Croix: est. 45,000
		St. Thomas:
		St. John: 10,000
		</p>
		<p>
		Charlotte Amalie in St. Thomas is the captial of the USVI. St. Thomas is extremely 
		hilly and hard to get around unless you have a car.
