		<h1>The Misadventures of the Fordies</h1>
		<h2>Across the three main U.S. Virgin Islands</h2>
		<p>
			I often wandered around downtown Christiansted on St. Croix and saw many exciting things.
			For example, hundreds of street chickens roamed the streets as if they were stray cats.
			Sometimes, I would see baby chicks snacked up by the cats too.
			P.S no one eats the chickens because they're "trash chickens" that eat garbage;
			think of them as raccoons of the daylight
		</p>
		<p>
			Every single day the sun beat down on me. I wore 70 SPF, wore a sun hat,
			and reapplied sunscreen daily. When I came to the USVI, I had black hair,
			and when I came back, my hair had been sun bleached to brown from all the
			time I spent in the water. Overall, I must have gone through 5 large bottles of sunscreen.
		</p>
		<h2>How to travel between the islands</h2>
		<p>
			Although three major islands are considered the main USVI islands, there are many smaller
			islands to visit. For example, Hotel on the Cay is an island right next to downtown Christiansted.
			You get to the Cay Islands on a boat docked in this random corner of the docks to go across the water.
			The distance from the pier to the Cay Island is swimmable if you're a good swimmer, but many boats and
			huge fish surround it. While swimming around  Cay Beach, my friend saw a huge string ray swimming next
			to her, and I saw many tiny jellyfish. The shore of this beach has a nice bar and live bands that come
			to play live music every Sunday.
